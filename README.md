# Guardian-FrontEnd-MarketingLeads
This application is pretty simple and is a combination of PHP and coffeescript that consumes data
from an API that controls access to marketing leads and orders taken in by Custom Glass Solutions
(a business unit of Guardian Industries). This can be a public repo since it doesn't contain any
passwords or other sensitive data.
